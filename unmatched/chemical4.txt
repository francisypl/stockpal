Dow Chemical (DOW) Closes Down After FDA Withdraws Approval of Herbicide
NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- The Dow Chemical Co. (DOW - Get Report)  shares slumped 2.74% to $51.92 on Wednesday as the EPA plans to revoke approval of the company's Enlist Duo herbicide, after new information showed the harmful effects of the weedkiller, the Wall Street Journal reports. 

Specifically, ingredients could be more toxic to nearby plants than the EPA had previously thought. 

Dow Chemical remains confident in its herbicide, stating "We are working with EPA to quickly provide further assurances that our product's conditions of registered use will continue to protect the environment, including threatened and endangered plant species," according to the Journal. 

Based in Midland, MI, Dow Chemical manufactures and supplies products that are used primarily as raw materials in the manufacture of customer products and services worldwide.

Separately, TheStreet Ratings team rates DOW CHEMICAL as a Buy with a ratings score of A-. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:

We rate DOW CHEMICAL (DOW) a BUY. This is based on the convergence of positive investment measures, which should help this stock outperform the majority of stocks that we rate. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its compelling growth in net income, largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures, attractive valuation levels, good cash flow from operations and notable return on equity. We feel its strengths outweigh the fact that the company shows low profit margins.
