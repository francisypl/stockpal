Air Liquide Set to Buy Airgas
Recently Airgas Inc. (ARG) agreed to be acquired by Air Liquide (AIQUF).

The deal will strengthen Air Liquide's global leadership with position in North America, complementing its positions in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia-Pacific, and will ideally position Air Liquide for future growth.

The combined companies will deliver greater value, service and innovation to customers and Air Liquide will benefit from Airgas' leading customer-facing platform including e-commerce and telesales capabilities.

Due to the highly complementary nature of the two businesses, this combination offers significant benefits for all of its stakeholders.

Airgas is the industry leader in U.S. packaged gases with a customer-centric organization. This acquisition increases Air Liquide's geographic reach in the resilient U.S. market, and offers continuous growth opportunities. This acquisition will increase Gas & Services sales by around 30%.

Air Liquide is accelerating its growth in the Turkish market with the acquisition of Messer Aligaz Sanayi Gazlari, a subsidiary of industrial gas company Messer Group GmbH. The combination of the two companies will further increase Air Liquide's capacity to create value for its customers and to sign a new long-term contract with Yan'an Energy, and Chemical Co., which is a major petroleum group in China and a subsidiary of Yanchang Petroleum International Ltd.
