FutureFuel Chemical Company Enters Into Contract Amendment to Extend Supply of NOBS Laundry Detergent Additive to Procter & Gamble Through 2018
CLAYTON, Mo., Oct. 1, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FutureFuel Corp. (FF), a manufacturer of custom and performance chemicals and biofuels (together with its subsidiaries, "FutureFuel"), today announced that on September 30, 2015, its subsidiary, FutureFuel Chemical Company ("FFCC"), signed a contract amendment to extend the supply of NOBS, a bleach activator laundry additive, to Procter & Gamble ("P&G") through 2018. P&G previously expressed its intent to terminate the NOBS supply arrangement effective December 31, 2015, but it has now been reinstated on amended terms. The amendment provides for sales of NOBS to P&G in reduced volumes with adjusted pricing during 2015-2018 to account for revised market conditions.

"We are very proud of our long-standing relationship with P&G," said Paul Flynn, FFCC Executive Vice President of Business & Marketing.

Mr. Flynn further stated that: "FFCC also has acquired certain intellectual property rights relating to NOBS laundry detergent formulations which will support sales to other laundry detergent manufacturers. NOBS is the highest performing bleach activator product on the market. FFCC already has evaluated NOBS in multiple commercial laundry detergent applications from around the world and demonstrated improved cleaning performance in particular at lower wash temperatures." According to the Swiss Agency for Efficient Energy Use (S.A.F.E.), washing at lower temperatures (max. 20*C/68*F) uses 70% less electricity compared to a 60*C/140*F cycle. "We believe our current NOBS products are very well suited to the continued trends of sustainable products that conserve resources and reduce CO2 emissions. While maintaining our important relationship with P&G, this amendment allows us to look for growth with other customers in the laundry detergent market," stated Flynn.
