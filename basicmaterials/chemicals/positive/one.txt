Air Products to Highlight Water-based Degreasing Solutions at Cleaning Products USA Conference 2015
LEHIGH VALLEY, Pa., Oct. 6, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Air Products' (APD) Materials Technologies segment will be featuring its Tomadyne® solutions for water-based degrease cleaning products at the Cleaning Products USA Conference in Alexandria, Virginia from October 7-9.

Many cleaning product formulators are trying to reduce solvent levels in their cleaning products and are exploring water-based degreasing formulations as an alternative. But achieving an optimized blend of surfactants in these situations can be difficult and time consuming.  Air Products' line of Tomadyne materials can help by providing a series of ready-to-use pre-blend surfactants that formulators can leverage to quickly and effectively create formulations without the need to purchase multiple products.

Air Products' Tomadyne family consists of three main products:

Tomadyne® 100 surfactant is an aggressive cleaner for systems containing low electrolyte levels;
Tomadyne® 102 surfactant offers a milder solution for low electrolyte-containing systems where corrosion to metals is a concern; and
Tomadyne® 108 surfactant provides excellent cleaning performance for systems containing higher levels of electrolytes
"Customers are looking to streamline their product creation process through simplified formulation designs and fewer raw material SKUs (stock-keeping units). By enabling creation of straightforward, high-performing water-based degreasing products with one surfactant solution, Tomadyne materials can allow cleaning brands to focus on all the other challenges associated with marketing their products," said Arnoldo Fonseca, Americas marketing manager for the Industrial & Institutional Cleaning solutions business at Air Products.

Tomadyne surfactants are part of Air Products' innovative portfolio of cleaning surfactants, which include offerings sold under the Tomadol®, Tomamine®, TomaKleen®, and Tomadry® brands. Cleaning Products conference attendees are invited to visit Air Products at the conference to learn about our complete range of solutions and how they can help power future cleaning formulations.
