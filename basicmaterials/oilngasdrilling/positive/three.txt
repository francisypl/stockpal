Transocean (RIG) Stock Rallies, Guggenheim Bullish on Oil Services Sector
NEW YORK (TheStreet) -- Transocean (RIG - Get Report)  shares are jumping 3.36% to $14.60 on Monday after Guggenheim Partners upgraded the company along with several offshore drillers to "buy" from "neutral."

For the first time in almost two years, the firm said that it's siding with the bulls as it believes that global oil market will start to tighten in the second quarter of 2016.

Specifically, oil prices are projected to increase further and faster than the "lower for longer" consensus estimates, Barron's.com reports.

Additionally, offshore drillers will benefit more from the "rising tide of fund flows into the energy sector than from any improvement in industry fundamentals," analysts noted.

Transocean stock is also getting a lift from higher oil prices as traders stayed hopeful ahead of this week's OPEC meeting, Reuters said.

Crude oil (WTI) is higher 1.53% to $42.35 per barrel and Brent crude is climbing 0.8% to $45.22 per barrel, according to the CNBC.com index.

Based in Switzerland, Transocean provides offshore contract drilling services for oil and gas wells worldwide.

Separately, TheStreet Ratings team rates TRANSOCEAN LTD as a Sell with a ratings score of D+. TheStreet Ratings Team has this to say about their recommendation:

We rate TRANSOCEAN LTD (RIG) a SELL. This is driven by some concerns, which we believe should have a greater impact than any strengths, and could make it more difficult for investors to achieve positive results compared to most of the stocks we cover. The company's weaknesses can be seen in multiple areas, such as its weak operating cash flow and generally disappointing historical performance in the stock itself.
