Time to Buy Offshore Drillers?
Yes, says Guggenheim’s Michael LaMotte ands team, who upgraded offshore drillers Atwood Oceanics (ATW), Transocean (RIG), Ensco (ESV), Rowan (RDC), and Noble (NE), among others, to Buy from Neutral. They explain why:


Bloomberg News
We have become bullish on the oil services sector for the first time in nearly two years, for three reasons: 1) we believe that the global oil market will begin to tighten in 2Q16 and that oil prices will rise further and faster than the “lower for longer” consensus expects, reaching $100/bbl by 2018; 2) energy’s low S&P weighting and high short interest suggest that supply and demand for oil services equities is out of balance and that the stocks have a lot of upside from sentiment simply getting less negative; and 3) as earnings bottom in 1H16, we expect investors will begin to look through the trough and focus more on the full-cycle upside evidenced by low price to tangible book value (TBV) and mid-cycle earnings multiples…

Offshore drillers. We believe these stocks will benefit more from the rising tide of fund flows into the energy sector than from any improvement in industry fundamentals. In fact, because of the magnitude of over-supply in the offshore rig market, and the significant reduction in the cost of stacking (vs. scrapping), we do not expect this segment of the market to show any improvement in utilization or day rates until the 2018-2019 time frame or return to mid-cycle earnings until
2020. Within this group, we prefer Atwood and Rowan, as 1) we believe their DP backlogs should help reduce near-term risk, 2) Rowan has no newbuild commitments and Atwood is finalizing a contract in Brazil for one of its two uncontracted rigs, 3) we think utilization in the Middle East (Rowan) and Australia (Atwood) should be resilient on a relative basis; and 4) both of the drillers have fleets (both in terms of rig specification and fleet size) that make them more interesting M&A candidates.
