Offshore Drillers: The Risks to 2017
For offshore drillers like Rowan (RDC), Atwood Oceanics (ATW), Ensco (ESV) and Transocean (RIG), “the issue is the risks to 2017 and the contracting hurdle to keep rigcount flat,” say Jefferies analyst Eduardo Royes and team. They explain why:

On the one hand, with high dayrate backlog rolling off in 2017E still, floater spending could be down another 15% even if activity is flattish. However, even if this reflects a 2014 to 2017 decline in floating rig expenditures of 40%, we cannot rest assured of the likelihood of this outcome either. Particularly unsettling is when an oil company touts its limited rig needs—e.g., Shell’s (RDS.A) recent investor day slide noting it will have 6 active deepwater rigs by YE17 versus 19 at YE14, as such suggests potentially no incremental rig needs regardless of budget. The fact is the industry would have to nearly quadruple its 2016 contracting pace to support stable-to-modest-growth in the active rig count through 2017, and there is no visibility supporting that pickup in contracting today.
Royes, however, does see potential for savings in capital spending. He explains:

Capex: an overlooked lever to-date? Capex savings across select players is arguably the most favorable recent trend, and the driver behind our mostly increased price targets. Specifically, we note Transocean’s >$400MM in capex savings between 2H15 and YE17, Ensco’s $250MM+, and Rowan’s nearly $100MM versus our prior expectations.

Royes rates Rowan a Buy “on its leverage to better than average jackup markets and FCF generation potential.” He still sees “contracting momentum and balance sheet improvement potential” helping Buy-rated Atwood, but sees “more limited upside versus before,” as his price target was cut to $19. Hold-rated Ensco, meanwhile, “looks much improved.”

Shares of Transocean have dropped 3.1% to $14.25 at 11:51 a.m. today, while Rowan has fallen 4.6% to $19.88, Atwood Oceanics has tumbled 6.8% to $15.28, and Ensco is off 5.1% at $17. Royal Dutch Shell has gained 1% to $51.05.
