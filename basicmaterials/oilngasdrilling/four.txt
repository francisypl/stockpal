China Cuts Natural Gas Prices: How Are Distributors Affected?
At last, in an attempt to boost the economy, China announced a cut to its benchmark non-residential city gate gas prices. This cut is applicable to about one-third of China’s total gas demand.

How would China’s gas distributors such as ENN Energy (2688.Hong Kong) and Beijing Enterprises (392.Hong Kong), as well as upstream suppliers such as PetroChina (0857.HK/PTR) and CNOOC (0883.HK/CEO), be affected? City gas distributors can benefit if cheaper prices bring about more demand. Goldman Sachs estimated this morning Beijing’s move could result in 6% year-on-year growth in 2016 gas demand.

The announced cut – 0.7/cum yuan – is bigger than the street expectations of RMB 0.4/cum. In addition, Beijing said the new non-residential price is now just a benchmark – distributors can raise their retail prices by up to 20% above the benchmark and lower their retail prices without any limit.

“We reiterate our cautious stance on the Chinese gas utilities sector…. the impact on earnings would be limited (5-6%) even if we were to assume the price cut could stimulate demand,” wrote UBS‘ Peter Gastreich and team this morning.

Back in September when rumors on natural gas price cuts started floating around, UBS conducted an earnings sensitivity analysis and found limited impact on distributors’ earnings. Back then, under the assumption that China cuts natural gas by RMB1.0/cum (more than the announced RMB0.7/cum cut), ENN Energy could see its earnings rise by 16% and 13% in 2016 and 2017; China Gas (384.Hong Kong), 5% and 8%; China Resources Gas (1193.Hong Kong), 8% and 6%. UBS saw no impact on Beijing Enterprises.

As for upstream suppliers PetroChina and CNOOC, this is not great news but not devastating either, because the oil majors are just so big. Goldman this morning cut PetroChina and CNOOC’s earnings by 3% and their price targets by 1%.
